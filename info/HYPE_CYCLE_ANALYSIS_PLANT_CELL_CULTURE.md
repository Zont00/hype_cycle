## Recommendations

Based on the current phase (**Peak of Inflated Expectations**), we recommend:


1. **Prepare for potential decline**: Peak often followed by trough within 1-3 years
2. **Evaluate practical applications**: Distinguish hype from real progress
3. **Monitor failure rates**: Increase in problem/challenge papers = entering Trough
4. **Track industry adoption**: Real products vs announcements and promises
5. **Be cautious with investment**: Peak is high-risk for new investments
